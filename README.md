## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm proud of this because I struggled to center the text. I spent a lot of time looking into how I can center the text in the div. No matter what I tried it wouldn't center so once I finally found the solution it really felt like a massive achievement (even though it was a simple issue).

```html

```
```css
.button {
    width: 19.929rem;
    height: 3.214rem;
    line-height: 3.214rem;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: var(--clr-grey);
    color: var(--clr-white);
    font-weight: 600;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```
```js

```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving on my CSS by doing all kinds of projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28279989/multiple-font-weights-one-font-face-query) - This helped set up the fonts for the website. I was getting an error in the console and this helped remove that error. 
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me fix the button text as it wasn't centering directing in the middle. It showed me how to use line-height to center the text.
